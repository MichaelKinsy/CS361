# Project 1: Deterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Michael Kinsy
* Class: CS361 Section 2 
* Semester: Fall 2021

## Overview

This java program models a deterministic finite automaton using packages, java collections, interfaces, and abstract classes.

## Compiling and Using

* Compilation
   - To compile run: javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java frotm the top directory of this project
* Using
   - To use run: java fa.dfa.DFADriver <path to input file>

## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * What problems did you have? What went well?
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

 This project was relatively straight forward to implement with most of the critical concepts being in setting up my DFAState properly and the data structures that stored these objects in my actual dfa class. 
## Testing

To test this project I simply used all of the provided testing files and compared my own programs output to the output expected within the project specifications which was correct after my final implementation.
